# SQL-Project-for-Data-Analysis--Pizza-Sales
The aim of this project is used to  determine pizza sales and perform sales analysis by using SQL queries as well as to visualize the sales data for comprehensive analysis. The visualizations and insights derived from these analyses can help in making informed decisions and strategies related to pizza sales. 
The key tasks involved in analyzing the data are: ​
Extracting relevant data from the database. ​
Calculating total sales, popular pizza types, and trends. ​​
Creating visualizations to communicate insights. ​

The specific SQL questions asked in the dashboard are as follows:

Retrieve the total number of orders placed. ​
Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales. ​​
Identify the highest-priced pizza. ​
Identify the most common pizza size ordered. ​
List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities. ​
Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered. ​
Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day. ​
Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas. ​
Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day. ​
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue. ​​
Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue. ​
Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time. ​
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category. ​
